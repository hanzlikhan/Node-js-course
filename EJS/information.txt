templating => blueprint
EJS => embedded javascript templates
a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain javascript

All files should be in the views directory for the template 


Interetation syntax

refers to the 

Includes:
agr html page ke andar bhi koi temlate use krna chahte hai to us keliye hm include ka use kare ge.
         <%- Include ("Includes/head.ejs") %>


         we will remove any code part of our file and we will add it to the include folder by making a file 
         then we can can include it to teh any file where it needed 


Static file ko serve kr skte hai 

app.use(express.static(folder.name))

this path is necessary to give in the index.js and we don't need to specify the full path for any file like 

public/style.css

we will just give path /style.css
coz we also specify the path in the index.js file 
public folder will serve all file in the response 


public folder require for the static file 
views folder require for the templates 
we can add multiple folder in the public folder and 
public folder will serve all 
we can add script tag
